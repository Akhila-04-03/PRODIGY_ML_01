# linear regression on house price-Machine learning task-01
# Introduction
This implement a linear regression model(simple linear regression and HistGradientBoostingRegressor) to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
# Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data   -This dataset includes various features of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
79 Different Features: The dataset includes a wide range of features such as living area, number of rooms, location, etc.
Categorical and Numerical: Features are a mix of categorical (like neighborhood or building type) and numerical (like square footage).
# Task
predict the sale price of houses in the test set using the features square footage,number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
